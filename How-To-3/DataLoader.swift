/*
    URLSession is the class that lets us decide how our DataTasks will be configured. At the end of the day, what actually connects to the servers are URLSessionDataTask(s):
    - That is to say, a URLSessionDataTask is an object/class that takes care of doing network call asynchronously.
    - If you check the method for dataTask, all it does is return a URLSessionDataTask object.
    - The closure is basically handling what that newly create object returns.
